# Debootstrap Install Notes
## Notes Before hand

canceled because Grub fucking sucks and I can't even. Maybe I am doing it wrong but I give up for now

**Update** It turns out that I was in fact doing this shit wrong. make a seperate EFI partition not a seperate boot partition. This partition would be mounted to `/boot/efi`

- install network manger once chrooted
- install arch-install-scripts before
- install debootstrap
